2. **Timer:**
   Add a timer to challenge players to complete the game within a specific time limit. Display the elapsed time throughout the game and provide feedback when the time limit is reached.

3. **Difficulty Levels:**
   Introduce multiple difficulty levels with varying grid sizes and numbers of symbols. Increase the challenge by adding more symbols or decreasing the grid size for higher difficulty levels.
